rn there are 2 folders, the demo folder is just a very simple pybullet demo along with a nice urdf to examine and learn a little about the file format.

the other one is for working with onshape-to-robot, there are some folders for the program to work with (including the config and the output I got for now) and there's a script to load the exported urdfs into a simple pybullet session for viewing
